## Prereqs<a name="prereqs"></a>

* Set up a fresh conda environment with Python >= 3.7: `conda create -n arrows python=3.7`

* Activate the environment: `conda activate arrows`.

* Install jupyter, biopandas, and biopython: **`pip install notebook biopandas Bio`**

## Instructions<a name="instruct"></a>

* Open the notebook to see the instructions. Briefly, the PDB files are parsed and a fasta-format output is generated for you to run a sequence alignment. This is then input to the second part of the notebook to generate a chimera bild file.
